Once upon a time there was a girl called Cinderella. But everyone called her Cinders. She lived with her mother and two stepsisters called Lily and Rosa. Lily and Rosa were very unfriendly and were very lazy girls. They spent all their time buying new clothes and going to parties. Poor Cinders had to wear all old lad I'll start again Poor Cinders had to wear their old hand me downs! And she had to do the cleaning! One day, a royal messenger came to announce a ball. The ball would be held at the Royal Palace, in honour of the Queen only son, Prince William. Lily and Rosa thought this was divine. Prince William was gorgeous, and he was looking for a bride! They dreamed of wedding bells! When the evening of the ball arrived, Cinders had to help her sisters get ready. They were in a bad moo and wanted to buy some new gowns, but their mother said they ha that they ha that they had they had enough gowns. So they started shouting at Cinders. 'Find me jewels!' one yelled. 'Find me a hat!' yelled the other. They wanted hairbrushes, hairpins and hairspray.
