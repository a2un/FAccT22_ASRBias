Once upon a time there was a girl called Cinderella. But everyone called her Cinder. Cinder lived with her mother and two stepsisters called Leila and Rosa. Leila and Rosa were very unfriendly and they were lazy girls. They spent all their time buying new clothes and going to parties. Poor Cinders had to wear all their old hand me downs! And she had to do the cleaning! One day, a royal messenger came to announce a ball. The ball would be held at the Royal Palace, in honour of Queen's only son, Prince William. Leila and Rosa thought that that this was divine. Prince William was glorious Prince Prince William was gorgeous, and he was looking for a bride! They dreamed of wedding bells! When the evening of the ball arrived, Cinder had to help he  her sisters get ready. They were in a bad mood. They wanted to buy some new gowns, but their mother said that they had enough gowns. So they started er start er sorry so they started shouting at Cinder. 'Find my jewels!' yelled one. 'Find my hat!' howled the other. They they wanted hairbrushes, hairpins and hairspray.
