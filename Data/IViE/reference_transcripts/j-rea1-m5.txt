Once upon a time there was a girl called Cinderella. But everyone knew her as Cinders. Cinders lived with her mother and two stepsisters called Lea and Rosa or Rose. Lea and Rosa were very unfriendly and were lazy girls. They spent all their time buying new clothes and going to parties. Poor Cinders had had to wear all their old their old hand me downs! And she had to clean, to do the cleaning! One day, a royal messenger came to announce a ball. The ball would be held at the Royal Palace, in honour of the Queen's only son, Prince William. Lea and Rose thought this was divine. Prince William was gorgeous, and he was looking for a bride! They dreamed of a wedding bells! When the evening of the ball arrived, Cinders had to help her sisters get ready. They were in a bad mood. They'd wanted to buy some new gowns, but their mother said that they had enough gowns. So they started shouting at Cinders. 'Find my jewellery!' yelled one. 'Find my hat!' yelled the other. They wanted hairbrushes, hairpins and hairspray.
