Lily and Rosa were very unfriendly and were lazy girls. They spent all their time buying new clothes and going to parties. Poor Cinders had to wear all their old hand me downs! And she had to do the cleaning! One day, a royal messenger came to announce a ball. The wall the ball would be held at the Royal Palace, in honour of the Queen's only son, Prince William. Lily and Rosa thought he was divine. Prince William was gorgeous, and he was he was looking for a bride! He dreamt, they dreamt of wedding bells! When the evening of the ball arrived, Cinders had to help her sisters get ready. They were in a bad mood. They wanted to buy some new gowns, but their mother said that they had enough gowns. So they started to shout at Cinders. 'Find my jewels!' yelled one. 'Find my hat!' howled the other howled the other one. They wanted hairbrushes, hairpins and hairspray.
